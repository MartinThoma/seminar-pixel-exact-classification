\section{Traditional Approaches}\label{sec:traditional-approaches}%
Image segmentation algorithms which use traditional approaches, hence don't
apply neural networks and make heavy use of domain knowledge, are wide-spread
in the computer vision community. Features which can be used for segmentation
are described in \cref{subsec:features}, a very brief overview of unsupervised,
non-semantic segmentation is given in
\cref{subsec:unsupervised-traditional-segmentation}, Random Decision
Forests are described in \cref{subsec:random-forests}, Markov Random Fields in \cref{subsec:markov-random-fields}
 and \glspl{SVM} in
\cref{subsec:trad-SVM}.
Postprocessing is covered in \cref{subsec:post-processing-methods}.

It should be noted that algorithms can use combination of methods. For example,
\cite{tighe2014scene} makes use of a combination of a \gls{SVM} and a
\gls{MRF}. Also, auto-encoders can be used to learn features which in turn
can be used by any classifier.
