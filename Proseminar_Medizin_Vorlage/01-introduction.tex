\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Semantic segmentation is the task of clustering parts of images together which
belong to the same object. This type of algorithm has several use-cases such as
detecting objects in robotics (TODO: cite), detecting street signs in
self-driving car software (TODO: cite), detecting tumors in medicine (TODO:
cite), detecting medical instruments in operations and distingushing them from
tissue (TODO: cite), colon crypts segmentation~\cite{cohen2015memory}. In
contrast, non-semantic segmentation only clusters pixels together (TODO:
improve wording). Hence the task of non-semantic segmentation is not
well-defined, as many different segmentations might be acceptable.

% Pixelwise segmentation is an imporant sub-task of many applications and can
% be applied to support even more applications: Understanding images (TODO:
% Cite paper google automatically labeling images), object detection (TODO:
% Cite a paper probably by Asfour), street detection (TODO: Cite), face
% detection (TODO: cite) and medical instrument detection (TODO: cite) are only
% a couple of the possible applications.

% In many applications speed and accuracy is crucial. In this paper, we
% summarize the current state of semantic segmentation.

This paper is organized as follows: We begin by giving a taxonomy of
segmentation algorithms. %in \cref{sec:taxonomy}.
A summary of quality measures and datasets which are used for semantic
segmentation. A summary of the most important traditional segmentation
algorithm and their characteristics follows, as well as a similar summary of
recently published semantic segmentation algorithms which are based on neural
networks. The next section informes the reader about typical problematic cases
for segmentation algorithms. As speed is one of the hard requirements in
practical applications, we outline some of the actions that can be applied to
improve the speed of segmentation algorithms. Finally, we mention some of the
publications which examine automatic image enhancement.
