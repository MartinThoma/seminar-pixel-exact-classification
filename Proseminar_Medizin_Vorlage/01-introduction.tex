\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Semantic segmentation is the task of clustering parts of images together which
belong to the same object. This type of algorithm has several use-cases such as
detecting objects in robotics (TODO: cite), detecting street signs in
self-driving car software (TODO: cite), detecting tumors in medicine (TODO: cite),
detecting medical instruments in operations and distingushing them from
tissue (TODO: cite).

% Pixelwise segmentation is an imporant sub-task of many applications and can
% be applied to support even more applications: Understanding images (TODO:
% Cite paper google automatically labeling images), object detection (TODO:
% Cite a paper probably by Asfour), street detection (TODO: Cite), face
% detection (TODO: cite) and medical instrument detection (TODO: cite) are only
% a couple of the possible applications.

% In many applications speed and accuracy is crucial. In this paper, we
% summarize the current state of semantic segmentation.


Taking a step back, the task of semantic segmentation can be grouped in several
categories:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{By possible classes}: Are the classes which should be distinguised
          known at the time when the algorithm is developed / trained or might
          there occur several objects which were never seen before?
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Fixed-class: All classes are known at training time.
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item Binary: street/no street.
              \end{itemize}
              \item Open-class: There might be completely new classes
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{By class affiliation of pixels}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Single class affiliation: Every pixel belongs to exactly one class. There might
                  be probabilities, but a pixel cannot belong with a 100\%
                  probability to two classes.
            \item Multiple class affiliation: A single pixel might belong to
                  multiple classes. An example is a glass on a table: One
                  knows that the glass is there and it is possible to see the
                  table below / behind. Another example is hair. Mattening
                  methods produce maps which reflect this property for hair.\cite{levin2008spectral}
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{By input data}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item greyscale / colored
              \item single image (NOTE: we write about this) / time series (NOTE: only mention it)
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Operation state}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item completely automatically <-- we write about this type
            \item interactive (e.g. user clicks on background or user makes a
                  coarse segmentation and automatically refinement) as
                  described in
                  \cite{protiere2007interactive,rother2004grabcut}.
            \item active as in
                  \cite{schiebener2011segmentation,schiebener2012discovery} or
                  passive, where the received image cannot be influenced
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
