This survey describes the state of the art of pixel-level semantic
segmentation. It is based on an extensive literature review. Metrics and
datasets for the evaluation of segmentation algorithms, traditional approaches
for segmentation as well as recently published approaches with convolutional
neural networks, typical problematic situations for segmentation algorithms,
possible approaches to achieve speed-ups as well as image enhancement
algorithms are examined.
