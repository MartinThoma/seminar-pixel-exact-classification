Pixelwise segmentation is an imporant sub-task of many applications and can be
applied to support even more applications: Understanding images (TODO: Cite paper google automatically labeling images), object detection (TODO: Cite a paper probably by Asfour),
street detection (TODO: Cite), face detection (TODO: cite) and medical instrument
detection (TODO: cite) are only a couple of the possible applications.

In many applications speed and accuracy is crucial. In this paper, we summarize
the current state of semantic segmentation.
