\subsection{Unsupervised Segmentation}%
\label{subsec:unsupervised-traditional-segmentation}%

Unsupervised segmentation algorithms can be used in supervised segmentation as
another source of information. While unsupervised segmentation algorithms can
never be semantic, they are well-studied and deserve at least a very brief
overview.

Semantic segmentation algorithms store information about the classes they were
trained to segment while non-semantic segmentation algorithms try to detect
consistent regions and region boundaries.

\subsubsection{Clustering Algorithms}
The $k$-means algorithm is a general-purpose clustering algorithm which
requires the number of clusters to be given beforehand. Initially, it places
the $k$ centroids randomly in the feature space. Then it assignes each
data point to the nearest centroid, moves the centroid to the center of the
cluster and continues the process until a stopping criterion is reached. A
faster variant is described in \cite{hartigan1975clustering}.

$k$-means was applied by~\cite{chen1998image} for medical image segmentation.

Another clustering algorithm is the mean-shift algorithm which was introduced
by~\cite{comaniciu2002mean} for segmentation tasks. The algorithm first applies
mean shift filtering on the original image data and then clusters the remaining
points.

% TODO: Understand this algorithm. Use \cite{comaniciu2002mean} and
% \cite{pantofaru2005comparison} for it.


\subsubsection{Graph Based Image Segmentation}%
\label{subsec:graph-based-image-segmentation}%
\href{http://cs.brown.edu/~pff/segment/}{cs.brown.edu}
See \cite{felzenszwalb2004efficient}.

TODO: See also \cite{pantofaru2005comparison} for another description.

A graph-based method which got the 2nd rank in the Pascal VOC 2010
challenge~\cite{everingham2010pascal} is described
in~\cite{carreira2010constrained}.


\subsubsection{Random Walks}

TODO

Notes from \cite{meilpa2001learning}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Normalized Cut (see \cite{shi2000normalized}) seems to be a special
          case of this
    \item Seems to be a \enquote{spectral method}
    \item This is pairwise clustering. Clusters points which are similar and
          optimize e.g. for maximum total intracluster similarity. In contrast,
          to statistical clustering which assumes a probabilistic model which
          generates the data, this only defines a similarity function.
    \item Spectral clustering is a similarity based method. Spectral clustering
          methods use eingenvalues / eigenvectors of the matrix obtained by the
          similarity function.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Edge Detection}

See \cite{kass1988snakes}. (TODO)


\subsubsection{Watershed Segmentation}\label{subsec:watershed}
The watershed algorithm takes a grayscale image and interprets it as a height
map. Low values are catchment basins and the higher values between two
neighboring catchment basins is the watershed. The catchment basins should
contain what the developer wants to capture. This implies that those areas
must be dark on grayscale images. The algorithm starts to fill the basins from
the lowest point. When two basins get connected, a watershed is found. The
algorithm stops when the highest point is reached.

A detailed description of the watershed segmentation algorithm is given
in~\cite{roerdink2000watershed}.

The watershed segmentation was used in~\cite{1260033} to segment white blood
cells. As the authors describe, the segmentation by watershed transform has
two flaws: Over-segmentation due to local minima and thick watersheds due to
plateaus.
