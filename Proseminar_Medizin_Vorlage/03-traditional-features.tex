\subsection{Features}\label{subsec:features}%
The choice of features is very important in traditional approaches.

Poselets were used successfully in \cite{bourdev2010detecting,brox2011object}.
Those features rely on manually added extra keypoints such as \enquote{right
shoulder}, \enquote{left shoulder}, \enquote{right knee} and \enquote{left
knee}. They were originally used for human pose estimation. Finding those extra
keypoints is easily possible for well-known image classes like humans. However,
it is difficult for classes like airplanes, ships, organs or cells where the
human annotators do not know the keypoints. Additionally, the keypoints have to
be chosen for every single class. There are strategies to deal with those
problems like viewpoint-dependent keypoints.

Image edges and texture patches were proposed in~\cite{brox2011object}.

Other features include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pixel color in different image spaces (e.g. 3~features for RGB,
          3~features for HSV, 1~feature for the gray-value).
    \item \Gls{HOG} features interpret the image as a discrete function
          $I: \mathbb{N}^2 \rightarrow \Set{0, \dots, 255}$ which maps the
          position to a color. For each pixel, there are two gradients: The
          partial derivative of $x$ and $y$. Now the original image got
          transformed to two feature maps of equal size which represents the
          gradient. These feature maps are splitted into patches and a
          histogram of the directions is calcualted for each patch. \gls{HOG}
          features are used in~\cite{bourdev2010detecting,felzenszwalb2010object}.
    \item SIFT: TODO
\end{itemize}
