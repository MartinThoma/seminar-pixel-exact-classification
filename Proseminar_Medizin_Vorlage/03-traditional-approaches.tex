\section{Traditional Approaches}\label{sec:traditional-approaches}%
Image segmentation algorithms which use traditional approaches, hence don't
apply neural networks and make heavy use of domain knowledge, are wide-spread
in the computer vision community. Features which can be used for segmentation
are described in \cref{subsec:features}, a very brief overview of unsupervised,
non-semantic segmentation is given in
\cref{subsec:unsupervised-traditional-segmentation}, Random Decision
Forests are described in \cref{subsec:random-forests}, Markov Random Fields in
\cref{subsec:markov-random-fields} and \glspl{SVM} in
\cref{subsec:trad-SVM}.
Pre- and Postprocessing are covered in \cref{subsec:preprocessing-methods} and
\cref{subsec:post-processing-methods}. The respective advantages of the
classifiers are discussed in \cref{subsec:traditional-approaches-discussion}.

\subsection{Pre-processing methods}\label{subsec:preprocessing-methods}%
A typical image is opened in RGB color space, but depending on the classifier
and the problem another color space might result in better segmentations. RGB,
YcBcr, HSL, Lab and YIQ are some examples used by \cite{cohen2015memory}.

\Gls{PCA} is applied by~\cite{chen2011pixel} to reduce the dimensionality of
the feature space.

\subsection{Post-processing methods}%
\label{subsec:post-processing-methods}%
Post-processing methods are an important part of traditional pixel-level
segmentation approaches. Active contour models are one example of a
post-processing method~\cite{kass1988snakes}.

A refinement of the found segmentation can be obtained by adjusting a found
semantic segmentation to match close edges. This was used
in~\cite{brox2011object} with an ultra-metric contour map
Map~\cite{arbelaez2009contours}


\subsection{Discussion}%
\label{subsec:traditional-approaches-discussion}%
According to \cite{pantofaru2005comparison}, the mean shift algorithm produces
segmentations that correspond well to human perception, but it is sensitive to
its parameters. Depending on them, different granularities of the segmentation
can be achieved. \cite{pantofaru2005comparison} draws the conclusion, that
the segmentations found by the graph based image segmentation approach
in \cite{felzenszwalb2004efficient} are inferior to the segmentations found
by the mean shift algorithm described in \cite{comaniciu2002mean}.
